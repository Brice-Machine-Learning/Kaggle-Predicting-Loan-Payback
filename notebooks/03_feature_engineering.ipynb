    "# Kaggle: Predict Loan Payback — Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook:** `03_feature_engineering.ipynb`\n",
    "**Author:** Brice Nelson\n",
    "**Organization:** Kaggle Series | Brice Machine Learning Projects\n",
    "**Date Created:** November 16, 2025\n",

    "## 🧭 Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on **feature engineering** for the *Predict Loan Payback* Kaggle competition.\n",
    "Feature engineering is where we convert domain knowledge and statistical insight into **predictive power**, increasing the model’s ability to distinguish between loans that are repaid vs. defaulted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas `02_data_cleaning.ipynb` prepared a clean, numeric, and aligned dataset, this notebook builds **new, informative features** that enhance model signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objectives**\n",
    "1. Import scaled training and test datasets from `/data/processed/`.\n",
    "2. Engineer domain-driven features (credit, income, debt, and loan characteristics).\n",
    "3. Validate distributions and inspect transformations.\n",
    "4. Export a feature-enhanced dataset for modeling.\n",

    "## 🧱 Feature Engineering Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "The engineered features planned for this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Financial Ratio Features**\n",
    "- **Loan-to-Income Ratio:** `loan_amount / annual_income`\n",
    "- **Debt-to-Income Bucket:** Flag or bin DTI levels\n",
    "- **Interest Rate Stress Feature:** Higher-than-expected interest rates relative to credit score\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Credit Behavior Features**\n",
    "- **Credit Score Buckets:** Very low → very high\n",
    "- **Grade/Subgrade Interactions:** E.g., `grade * subgrade`\n",
    "- **Creditworthiness Flags:** Threshold-based indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Loan Purpose & Behavior Features**\n",
    "- One-hot interactions (e.g., `purpose × credit_score_bucket`)\n",
    "- Risk grouping based on purpose type\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Optional Modeling-Useful Transforms**\n",
    "- Log transforms for skewed features\n",
    "- Quantile transforms (if needed)\n",

    "## 📥 Load Processed Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The processed datasets created in `02_data_cleaning.ipynb` will now be imported from:\n",
    "`../data/processed/loan_train_scaled.csv` and `../data/processed/loan_test_scaled.csv`.\n",
