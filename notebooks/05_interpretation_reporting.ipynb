    "## 🧭 Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook delivers the **interpretation, reporting, and model diagnostics** stage of the *Predict Loan Payback* workflow.\n",
    "After training and evaluating multiple machine-learning models in the previous notebook, we now focus on **understanding what the model learned**, **communicating results**, and **extracting actionable insight** from the predictive system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step transforms raw performance metrics into a clear narrative that explains *why* the model works and *how* borrowers’ attributes influence repayment behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Analyze feature importance across top-performing models.\n",
    "2. Generate visual explanations (e.g., SHAP values, permutation importance).\n",
    "3. Interpret how borrower characteristics influence predicted repayment probability.\n",
    "4. Evaluate model robustness and identify potential sources of bias.\n",
    "5. Summarize model performance in a clear, competition-ready narrative.\n",
    "6. Prepare final documentation to support your chosen model(s) for submission.\n",
