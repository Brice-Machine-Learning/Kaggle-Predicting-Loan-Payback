    "# Kaggle: Predict Loan Payback — Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook:** `04_model_training.ipynb`\n",
    "**Author:** Brice Nelson\n",
    "**Organization:** Kaggle Series | Brice Machine Learning Projects\n",
    "**Date Created:** November 16, 2025\n",
    "**Last Updated:** November 16, 2025\n",

    "## 🧭 Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook initiates the **modeling phase** for the *Predict Loan Payback* competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing data cleaning and feature engineering in previous notebooks, we now transition into selecting, training, evaluating, and comparing machine-learning models capable of predicting whether a borrower will repay the loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step turns the carefully prepared dataset into an **actionable predictive system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objectives**\n",
    "1. Load feature-engineered train/test datasets from `/data/processed/`.\n",
    "2. Define the target variable and feature matrix.\n",
    "3. Train baseline models to establish initial performance benchmarks.\n",
    "4. Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (AUC, accuracy, precision/recall, etc.).\n",
    "5. Compare multiple algorithms and select the strongest candidate(s).\n",
    "6. Export predictions for Kaggle submission.\n",

    "## 🧱 Model Training Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "The modeling plan for this notebook includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Baseline Models**\n",
    "- Logistic Regression (regularized)\n",
    "- Decision Tree (simple depth-limited version)\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: establish “floor” performance quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Core Machine Learning Models**\n",
    "- Random Forest\n",
    "- Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM)\n",
    "- Extra Trees Classifier\n",
    "- Support Vector Machine (if practical)\n",
    "\n",
    "These will form the backbone of your model comparison phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Hyperparameter Tuning**\n",
    "- RandomizedSearchCV for broad sweeps\n",
    "- GridSearchCV for refining top models\n",
    "- Evaluation via stratified cross-validation\n",
    "- Tracking overfitting by comparing train vs. validation scores\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Model Evaluation Metrics**\n",
    "Depending on competition scoring:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ROC AUC** (typical for binary classification)\n",
    "- **Accuracy**\n",
    "- **Precision / Recall**\n",
    "- **Confusion matrix**\n",
    "- **Calibration curves** (optional but useful for loan risk)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Prediction & Export**\n",
    "- Predict on the processed test dataset\n",
    "- Format output to match Kaggle’s expected submission CSV\n",
    "- Save to `/data/submissions/`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📥 Load Feature-Engineered Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook begins by importing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `../data/processed/loan_train_features.csv`\n",
    "- `../data/processed/loan_test_features.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "(or whichever filenames you created in the feature engineering notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "These will be used to construct the feature matrix `X` and target vector `y` for training and validation.\n"
